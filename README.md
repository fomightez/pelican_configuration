Wayne's Fomightiest Blog
------------------------
This is a port of my blog to the [Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/)
blogging platform.  It doesn't contain the 'output' or '_build' directories pelican will generate.

It is based on  the [Pelican Boostrap 3 theme](https://github.com/DandyDev/pelican-bootstrap3).

Requirements
------------

- The [Pelican Boostrap 3 theme](https://github.com/DandyDev/pelican-bootstrap3). My customized variation can be found ????? <---- REPLACE WHEN UPLOADED. As described [here](https://github.com/DandyDev/pelican-bootstrap3#installation), you point the `THEME` variable in your `pelicanconf.py` to `/path/to/pelican-bootstrap3` .

- Recent version of
  [pelican-plugins](http://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins):
  Make sure the path is specified correctly in `pelicanconf.py`.

- Recent version of [Pelican](http://github.com/getpelican/pelican).  For
  the static paths (downloads, images, figures, etc.) to appear in the right
  place, Pelican 3.3+ must be used.
